    We're waiting every night
    To finally roam and invite
    Newcomers to play with us
    For many years we've been all alone
    We're forced to be still and play
    The same songs we've known since that day
    An imposter took our life away
    Now we're stuck here to decay
    Please let us get in
    Don't lock us away
    We're not like what you're thinking
    We're poor little souls
    Who have lost all control
    And we're forced here to take that role
    We've been all alone
    Stuck in our little zone
    Since 1987
    Join us, be our friend
    Or just be stuck and defend
    After all you only got
    Five nights at Freddy's
    Is this where you want to be?
    I just don't get it
    Why do you want to stay?
    Five nights at Freddy's
    Is this where you want to be?
    I just don't get it
    Why do you want to stay?
    Five nights at Freddy's, oh
    We're really quite surprised
    We get to see you another night
    You should have looked for another job
    You should have said to this place goodbye
    It's like there's so much more
    Maybe you've been in this place before
    We remember a face like yours
    You seem acquainted with those doors.</p>
